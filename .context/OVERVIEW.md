# Rota Web App - Overview

## Project Vision
To build the most visually stunning and responsive web implementation of the ancient Roman game **Rota**, leveraging the best web technologies available as of February 2026. The focus is on a high-fidelity, hyper-modern 2D user experience with fluid animations and a "glassmorphism" aesthetic.

## Core Gameplay
- **Game:** Rota (3 pieces per player, 3-in-a-row win condition).
- **Mode:** Single Player vs CPU.
- **Difficulty:** Adjustable CPU difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).

## Technical Philosophy
- **Visuals First:** Prioritize visual impact and smooth motion (60fps+) over legacy device support.
- **Modern Stack:** Utilize the React ecosystem's bleeding edge (Next.js App Router, React 19, Tailwind v4).
- **Client-Side Logic:** Game state and AI logic run entirely in the browser (WASM/JS) for instant feedback.

## Target Audience
Players who appreciate both strategy games and high-quality digital design.
