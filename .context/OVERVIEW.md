# Rota Web App - Overview

## Project Vision
To build the most visually stunning and responsive web implementation of the ancient Roman game **Rota**, leveraging the best web technologies available as of February 2026. The focus is on a high-fidelity user experience with an **"Imperial Senate"** aesthetic, featuring Tyrian Purple and Imperial Gold accents on a Deep Marble background.

## Core Gameplay
- **Game:** Rota (3 pieces per player, 3-in-a-row win condition).
- **Modes:**
    - Human vs Human (Local Multiplayer).
    - Human vs CPU.
- **Difficulty:** Adjustable CPU difficulty (Novice, Legionary, Senator).

## Technical Philosophy
- **Visuals First:** Prioritize visual impact and smooth motion (60fps+) using Framer Motion.
- **Modern Stack:** Utilize the React ecosystem's bleeding edge (Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4).
- **Performance:** Game state and AI logic run entirely in the browser, with AI computation offloaded to Web Workers for non-blocking UI.

## Target Audience
Players who appreciate both strategy games and high-quality digital design with a classical Roman theme.
