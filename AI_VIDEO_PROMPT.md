# AI Video Generation Prompt for Rota

## Recommended Tool
**Google Veo 3** (via Google AI Pro / Gemini Advanced subscription)
*Rationale:* As of Feb 2026, Veo 3 offers superior physics simulation for object movement (sliding pieces), native audio generation (sound effects), and high fidelity for textures (marble, gold).

## The Prompt

Copy and paste the following block into the Google Veo 3 interface. You may need to generate a few variations to get the perfect shot.

> **Subject:** A cinematic, photorealistic 3D close-up of an ancient Roman board game called "Rota" (a wheel with 8 spokes) carved into white marble.
>
> **Visual Style:**
> - **Lighting:** Warm, golden hour sunlight casting soft shadows, illuminating the texture of the marble.
> - **Materials:** The board is weathered white marble with gold inlay lines.
> - **Pieces:** Three pieces of "Tyrian Purple" (deep reddish-purple glass) and three pieces of "Imperial Gold" (polished metal coins).
> - **Camera:** Macro lens, shallow depth of field, focusing on the pieces. Smooth, slow-motion panning.
>
> **Action Sequence:**
> 1.  **Placement:** A hand (or invisible force) places a purple glass piece on the outer rim. Then a gold coin is placed on the center spot.
> 2.  **Movement:** The view shifts slightly. A purple piece slides smoothly along a carved line from the rim to the center, making a satisfying *clack*.
> 3.  **Victory:** A final gold piece slides into place, completing a line of three gold coins across the diameter of the wheel. The coins gleam brightly as they align.
>
> **Audio:**
> - Ambient sound of a quiet Roman courtyard (faint birds, wind).
> - Distinct, heavy *clack* and *slide* sounds of glass and metal moving on stone.
> - A subtle, triumphant musical swell when the three coins align.
>
> **Technical:** 4K resolution, 60fps, high dynamic range.

## Tips for Generation
*   **Physics:** If the pieces slide "through" each other, add the keyword "solid rigid body physics" to the prompt.
*   **Pacing:** If the video is too fast, ask for "slow, instructional pacing".
*   **Consistency:** If the board shape changes, upload a reference image of the Rota board (a circle with a cross and an X inside) to guide the generation.
